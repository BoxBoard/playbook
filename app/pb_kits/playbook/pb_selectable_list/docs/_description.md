Selectable List Kit can take variants checkbox and radio. Regardless of which variant type, each selectable list item needs a `value`, `name`, and `id` (these props are `<input>` attributes).

The Selectable List Item`id` prop will provide the `for` attribute to `<label>` in the kit, so no additional attributes are needed for the association between `<label>` and `<input>`.
