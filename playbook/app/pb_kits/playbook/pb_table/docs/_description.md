Tables display a collection of structured data and typically have the ability to sort, filter, and paginate data. Good data tables allows the user to scan, analyze, compare, filter, and sort information to derive insights and commit actions.
Table shift and alignment attributes can work in conjunction with each other, as well as be applied to the table header (not just the table body).
